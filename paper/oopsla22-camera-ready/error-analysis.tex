\section{A Case for Parse Error Repair}
\label{sec:error-analysis}

We motivate \toolname by analyzing a dataset
comprising \emph{1,100,000 erroneous Python programs}
and their respective fixes.
%
This dataset was gathered from PythonTutor.com~\citep{Guo2013}
between the years 2017 and 2018, previously used in related
work~\citep{Endres2019, Cosman2020}.
%
Each program which throws an uncaught \python exception
is paired with the next program by the same user that does
not crash, under the assumption that the latter is the fixed
version of the former.
%
We discard pairs that are too different between buggy
and fixed versions, since these are usually unrelated
submissions or complete refactorings.
%
We also discard submissions that violate PythonTutor's
policies (\eg, those using forbidden libraries).
%
The resulting dataset contains usable program pairs,
representing students from dozens of universities
(PythonTutor has been used in many introductory
courses~\citep{Guo2013}) as well as non-traditional
novices.

One might imagine that parse (or \emph{syntax}) errors are
usually easier to locate and repair than other algorithmic
or runtime errors \citep{Denny_2012}.
%
For example, the Python parser will immediately inform the programmer
about missing parentheses in function argument lists or improper
indentation.
%
However, as has also been shown in previous work \citep{Ahadi_2018,
Kummerfeld2003}, our data confirm that programmers (especially novices) deal
with these kinds of errors regularly and spend a considerable amount of time
fixing them.

\mypara{Observation 1: Parse errors are very common}
%
\autoref{fig:error-statistics} presents the statistics
of the different types of errors that users encountered
in this dataset.
%
We observe that $77.4 \% $ of all faulty programs failed
with a syntax error, accounting for the vast majority of
the errors that (novice) programmers face with their
programs.
%
The second category is merely $13.6\%$ of the dataset and
represents Python type errors. This is a strong indication
that parse errors are a very common category of error.

\mypara{Observation 2: Parse errors take time to fix}
%
The web-based compiler used to obtain this
dataset provides \emph{server timestamps}.
%
The timestamp is associated with each program attempt
submission, erroneous or not. The \emph{repair time}
is the difference between the erroneous and
fixed program timestamps.
%
This timing can be imprecise,
as there are various reasons these timings may be exaggerated,
(\eg, users stepping away from the computer, internet lag \etc).
%
However, in aggregate, due to the large
dataset size, these timings
can still be viewed as an approximate metric
of the time it took novice programmers to
repair their errors.

\autoref{fig:repair-rate} shows the \emph{programmer repair rate},
\ie the dataset percentage that is repaired under a given amount of time.
%
It presents the repair rate for parse errors and the rest
of the error types, grouped together here as \emph{runtime} errors.
%
As expected, parse errors are fixed faster than the rest,
but \emph{not by a large difference}.
%
For example, we observe that within 2 minutes,
$46\%$ of the runtime errors are repaired, while
$63\%$ of the syntax errors are.
%
Although this is a non-trivial difference,
we observe that there are still many
``simpler'' parse errors that required
more than 2 minutes to fix.

      \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{median-repair-times.pdf}
      \caption{The average time the user needed to fix the erroneous program
      for the needed token changes.}
      \label{fig:token-changes}
  \end{minipage}
\end{figure}

\mypara{Observation 3: Parse errors may need multiple edits to fix}
%
The average \emph{token-level changes} needed to fix a program with syntax
errors, \ie the number of changes in the lexed program token sequence, is
\emph{10.7 token changes}, while the \emph{median is 4}.
%
(This does not count lexeme content changes, such as variable renamings,
and thus underapproximates the work required.)
%
As shown in \autoref{fig:token-changes-ratio}, $14.2\%$ of errors
need only 1 token change, $23.2\%$ need 2 token changes, $7.0\%$
need 3 and $9.0\%$ need 4.
% Ultimately, $53.4\%$ of these errors needs at most 4 token changes to be fixed.
Ultimately, $46.6\%$ of these errors require more than 4 token changes.
%
% It is also important to see how long it takes the users on average to make
% those changes.

\mypara{Observation 4: Parse errors with more edits take longer to fix}
%
\autoref{fig:token-changes} shows the average time for users to fix
syntax errors as a function of the number of token changes needed.
As expected, with an increasing number of token changes needed,
programmers need more time to implement those changes. Most importantly, even
for 1 or 2 token changes the average user spends \emph{25 sec},
which is still a considerable amount of time for such simple and
short fixes. The repair time jumps to \emph{56 sec} for three token changes.

\smallskip
These four observations indicate that, while some errors can be
easily and quickly fixed by programmers using existing error messages,
there are many cases where novices struggle with fixing syntax errors.
%
Therefore, we can conclude that an automated tool that parses and repairs
such programs in only a few seconds could benefit many novices.
